		Basically we can't control particle position in 3D space.it start with 0,end with 1.but normal 3d space
have a 3 demensions and start with 0 end with big number so it hard to control a particle position in 3D space.
To solve this problem apply some expresssion.

Effect=CC Particle World.
Property=Position.

Position X:
	x=thisComp.layer("Position Of Particles").transform.position[0]-thisComp.width/2;
	x/thisComp.width;

Position Y:
	y=thisComp.layer("Position Of Particles").transform.position[1]-thisComp.height/2;
	y/thisComp.width;

Position Z:
	z=thisComp.layer("Position Of Particles").transform.position[2];
	z/thisComp.width;
